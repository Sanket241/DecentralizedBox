##DecentralizedBox

Decentralized Box is an innovative platform that leverages the power of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to allow users to securely upload and share images. Valid users can upload their pictures to IPFS, ensuring decentralized and distributed storage. Other users can view these pictures and contribute by writing about them, sharing their thoughts and insights.
